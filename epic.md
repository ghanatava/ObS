# Epic: Distributed Object Store Implementation

This epic tracks the major milestones and tasks required to build a robust, redundant object storage system.

## ✅ Epics & Tasks

### 1. Storage Engine
- [ ] Define chunking strategy and implement chunker
- [ ] Integrate Reed-Solomon erasure coding library
- [ ] Develop chunk replication mechanism (configurable factor)
- [ ] Implement self-healing background re-replication

### 2. Metadata Service
- [ ] Design metadata schema for object → chunk mappings
- [ ] Choose and provision persistent store (etcd/Cassandra)
- [ ] Implement metadata read/write API with quorum logic
- [ ] Implement versioning and immutability in metadata

### 3. Placement & Hashing
- [ ] Design consistent hashing ring with virtual nodes
- [ ] Implement data placement strategy (rack awareness)
- [ ] Develop membership and failure detection via heartbeats

### 4. Client API & Gateway
- [ ] Define RESTful API spec (PUT/GET/DELETE)
- [ ] Build API gateway service with authentication
- [ ] Implement multipart upload support
- [ ] Add client SDK examples (Go, Python, JavaScript)

### 5. Infrastructure & DevOps
- [ ] Containerize all services (Dockerfiles)
- [ ] Create Docker Compose & Kubernetes manifests
- [ ] Setup CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions/Jenkins)
- [ ] Integrate monitoring (Prometheus) & alerting

### 6. Testing & QA
- [ ] Write unit tests for chunking, EC, metadata
- [ ] Develop integration tests for failure recovery
- [ ] Load testing and benchmarking
- [ ] Security audit and penetration testing

### 7. Documentation & Onboarding
- [ ] Finalize this README with architecture diagrams
- [ ] Write CONTRIBUTING.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- [ ] Publish API docs (Swagger/OpenAPI)
